        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

				What are OERs?
			</div>
			<div class ="sectionText">
				OER stands for Open Educational Resources. They are freely accessible, openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching, learning, assessing, and research. The list we have available for access from this application ranges from GCF Learn Free to Khan Academy.

				Why OERs?
			</div>
			<div class="sectionText">
					OERs are free of charge to use and can significantly decrease student expenses on educational readings and content. Compared to textbooks, OERs help turn learning into an interactive and more interesting way for people to retain information. OERs can also circulate quickly, providing users with information they can access at any time.

				Money Saved
			</div>
			<div class="sectionText">
				Students do not have to pay to access OERs. A user needs a computer and internet connection to access these resources.
